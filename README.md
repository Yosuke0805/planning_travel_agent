# Summary
üåç AI Agent to suggest travel plan

# Background
Since I love traveling and have been to already 33 counties, I've spent so much time on seaching where I could go next to explore with limited budget looking all over the youtube, flight tickets and hostels to find the best route.
So, I developed AI agent can suggest travel plan based on all of my conditions such as my interests, budget,  countries that I alredy visited, etc.
This Agent utilizes Gemini model so it requires Gemini API which is free of charge!!(I love Gemini API great appriciation for Google)
You can generate your Gemini API key [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)


# How to use it
1. Generate Gemini API key
2. Click 'Others' and input Gemini APi key on sidebar.
3. Chat with Agent!

# Next thing you can do
Once you set your ideal destination, you can check out my another application to give you more detailed.
